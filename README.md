# Heart Disease Classifier

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify heart disease patients using three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. After tuning the models, Logistic Regression showed the best performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease dataset, which contains various medical attributes of patients.
## Data Exploration
Performed thorough data exploration using pandas to understand the distribution and relationships between features.

## Model Training and Tuning
Trained three models using scikit-learn and tuned them using RandomizedSearchCV. Logistic Regression showed the best accuracy.

## Evaluation
Used matplotlib to visualize the results and various evaluation metrics to assess model performance.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages
3. Run the notebooks or scripts in the `src/` folder
